Project for the Knowledge Systems course, involving tracing the location of contamination in
water. It consists of two parts:
* Representation of the static knowledge of the problem (monitoring station locations, pipe arrangement,
  water sources). Performed using Protege (.pins,.pont,.pprj files).
* CLIPS code to trace the source of the contamination based on different measurements (.clp files).
