# university-projects
This repository contains projects and assignments I completed during my 4 year bachelor's degree in informatics in
Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

A description of each project can be found in the respective README file inside its folder.
Most of the projects are accompanied by a LaTeX report (in Greek) documenting the thought process
and the code of the project.

## Highlights
* [Compiler design](compiler-design): Compiler of a toy language into MIXAL code.
* [Database technology](database-technology): Custom database format and R-Tree for storing n-dimensional points.
* [Information retrieval](information-retrieval): Backend of a search engline for the proceedings of the Greek parliament.
* [Networks](networks): GUI Client and Server for a custom email protocol.
