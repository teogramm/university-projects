Project for the Database Technology course. It consists of two parts:
* Creating a custom format for storing n-dimensional points on disk.
* Creating an R-Tree for indexing the points in the database.
Additionally, algorithms for nearest neighbour and range search (find all
points in the specified rectangular area) were implemented, using the R-Tree.
